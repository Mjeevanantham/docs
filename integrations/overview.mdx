## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OAuth Connection Fails**:
- Check that redirect URLs match exactly
- Verify OAuth credentials are correct
- Ensure required scopes are granted

**API Key Not Working**:
- Verify the API key is correct
- Check that the key hasn't expired
- Ensure the key has the required permissions

**Webhook Not Receiving Events**:
- Verify the webhook URL is accessible
- Check webhook signature verification
- Review webhook logs for errors

**Integration Sync Fails**:
- Check integration status
- Review error messages in the dashboard
- Verify credentials are still valid

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your integrations clearly (e.g., "Production Notion Workspace")
2. **Test Before Production**: Always test integrations in a development environment first
3. **Monitor Status**: Regularly check integration status for errors
4. **Secure Credentials**: Never share integration credentials
5. **Review Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to integrations
